Assuming default R0 value is 3.2 (SEIR model), after 15 weeks in the fall semester, the total amount of infected students will be  456



After removing five classes with highest centrality, the expected value of R0 will decrease by 7.077067669172932 percentage 
R0 value decreases from 3.2(default) to 2.9735338345864664
The total amount of infected students will decrease to 364


After removing ten classes with highest centrality, the expected value of R0 will decrease by 11.259398496240603 percentage 
R0 value decreases from 3.2(default) to 2.839699248120301
The total amount of infected students will decrease to 316


After opening the dining hall(assuming all possible students will have lunch in the dining hall),
the expected value of R0 will increase by 2669.7126745435016 percentage 
R0 value increases from 3.2(default) to 88.63080558539205
In this case, almost all the students will be infected



After closing classrooms with highest flow rate each day(simply assuming students in the same room are connected each day),
the expected value of R0 will increase by 38.62637576323261 percentage 
R0 value decreases from 3.2(default) to 1.9639559755765568
The total amount of infected students will decrease to 115
